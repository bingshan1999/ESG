Bitcoin and Crypto Closing Out Lame Quarter and One Analyst Believes More Pain Could Be in Store,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/28/bitcoin-and-crypto-closing-out-lame-quarter-and-one-analyst-believes-more-pain-could-be-in-store/,"Thielen noted that many trend-following funds are looking at the same signals and might be inclined to pile into short positions.
Also in play were macro factors – namely the anticipation of a sizable series of interest rate cuts in 2024 from the u.s. federal reserve.
Thielen also reminded about seasonality.
Bitcoin's disappointing second quarter price action, for now, can possibly be thought of as a correction within a larger bull move that saw the token rise nearly five-fold from january 2023 lows to a new all-time record above $73,500 in mid-march of this year.
With etf inflows old news and even on occasion reversing to outflows, and hopes for lower interest rates diminishing daily, buyers appear to have taken to the sidelines until a new catalyst arises.
In addition, while some bulls may have been excited that the presidential debate seemed to favor donald trump – who has recently come out as notably pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin – thielen suggested president biden's poor performance heightened the chance of a replacement democratic nominee who might end up as a far more formidable opponent in the november election.
Anticipation of the spot bitcoin etf approval, then the approval, and then the massive inflows into the new funds were surely major catalysts for the rise.","Sentence 1:

On friday at 08:00 utc, bitcoin (btc) options worth $6.68 billion and ether (eth) options worth $3.5 billion are set to expire on the leading crypto derivatives exchange deribit.
The recent price drop was caused by miner sales, some pressure from german-seized btc, and, of course, the imminent transfer of mt. gox coins expected in early july.
