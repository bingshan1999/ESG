Bitcoin and Crypto Closing Out Lame Quarter and One Analyst Believes More Pain Could Be in Store,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/28/bitcoin-and-crypto-closing-out-lame-quarter-and-one-analyst-believes-more-pain-could-be-in-store/,"With etf inflows old news and even on occasion reversing to outflows, and hopes for lower interest rates diminishing daily, buyers appear to have taken to the sidelines until a new catalyst arises.
Anticipation of the spot bitcoin etf approval, then the approval, and then the massive inflows into the new funds were surely major catalysts for the rise.
Thielen noted that many trend-following funds are looking at the same signals and might be inclined to pile into short positions.
Thielen also reminded about seasonality.
Bitcoin's disappointing second quarter price action, for now, can possibly be thought of as a correction within a larger bull move that saw the token rise nearly five-fold from january 2023 lows to a new all-time record above $73,500 in mid-march of this year.
In addition, while some bulls may have been excited that the presidential debate seemed to favor donald trump – who has recently come out as notably pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin – thielen suggested president biden's poor performance heightened the chance of a replacement democratic nominee who might end up as a far more formidable opponent in the november election.","Sentence 1:
