Bitcoin and Crypto Closing Out Lame Quarter and One Analyst Believes More Pain Could Be in Store,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/28/bitcoin-and-crypto-closing-out-lame-quarter-and-one-analyst-believes-more-pain-could-be-in-store/,"Bitcoin's disappointing second quarter price action, for now, can possibly be thought of as a correction within a larger bull move that saw the token rise nearly five-fold from january 2023 lows to a new all-time record above $73,500 in mid-march of this year.
With etf inflows old news and even on occasion reversing to outflows, and hopes for lower interest rates diminishing daily, buyers appear to have taken to the sidelines until a new catalyst arises.
Also in play were macro factors – namely the anticipation of a sizable series of interest rate cuts in 2024 from the u.s. federal reserve.
In addition, while some bulls may have been excited that the presidential debate seemed to favor donald trump – who has recently come out as notably pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin – thielen suggested president biden's poor performance heightened the chance of a replacement democratic nominee who might end up as a far more formidable opponent in the november election.
Thielen noted that many trend-following funds are looking at the same signals and might be inclined to pile into short positions.
Thielen also reminded about seasonality.
Anticipation of the spot bitcoin etf approval, then the approval, and then the massive inflows into the new funds were surely major catalysts for the rise.","Sentence 1:

Not long after, bankman-fried was arrested and the u.s. congress held hearings.

Nine days after allison’s initial story, bankman-fried’s companies filed for bankruptcy protection.
Almost immediately, binance got cold feet, as revealed by another polk-winning scoop from allison that instantly drove down prices in the entire crypto market.

","Wang, a deputy managing editor, provided the third coindesk scoop honored by the polk awards: a story revealing that bankman-fried and nine co-workers lived together in a luxury bahamas condominium and at times dated each other while running his companies – including the fact that bankman-fried and alameda ceo caroline ellison had once been a couple.
Not long after, bankman-fried was arrested and the u.s. congress held hearings.
The resulting story raised concerns about the stability of alameda and ftx, and called into question bankman-fried’s image as a white knight capable of backstopping struggling companies and as an 'adult in the room' in a field notorious for fly-by-night outfits and scammers.
Nine days after allison’s initial story, bankman-fried’s companies filed for bankruptcy protection.
Almost immediately, binance got cold feet, as revealed by another polk-winning scoop from allison that instantly drove down prices in the entire crypto market.
The piece raised concerns about nepotism, secrecy and conflicts of interest, previewing the tone of a scathing report issued soon after on ftx’s extremely lax administrative procedures.","Include,Include,Include,Include,Include,Include

Having more than 25% of open interest set to expire in the money means a significant number of derivative contracts are expected to be profitable for their holders at expirations.
Large quarterly expiries often lead to increased volatility, making prices more unpredictable due to higher trading volumes and the closing/rollover of positions.
On friday at 08:00 utc, bitcoin (btc) options worth $6.68 billion and ether (eth) options worth $3.5 billion are set to expire on the leading crypto derivatives exchange deribit.
While short-term bearish sentiment is evident, traders anticipate a positive shift for bitcoin by july 12 and eth by july 5, looking at options skew.
The recent price drop was caused by miner sales, some pressure from german-seized btc, and, of course, the imminent transfer of mt. gox coins expected in early july.
The impending expiry, which represents over 40% of the current cumulative open interest of over $23 billion, could trigger a surge in market volatility.
As we approach friday's large quarterly expiry, potentially influenced by 'quadruple witching' and related volatility in u.s. stock markets, over 25% of deribit open interest is set to expire in-the-money, equating to over $2.7 billion.

While it does not directly address environmental or social issues, it does touch on social aspects by mentioning ""offering Japanese investors crypto access."" This could imply an effort to enhance financial inclusion, which is a positive social impact. However, the mention of a ""preferential tax structure"" raises potential governance concerns regarding tax compliance and ethical business practices. The focus on reducing yen exposure is primarily a financial strategy and does not directly relate to ESG issues. Overall, this sentence has some relevance to social and governance aspects but lacks a direct connection to environmental concerns.

    This sentence highlights the motivations behind Metaplanet's Bitcoin purchases, focusing on financial strategy and market access for investors. While it mentions providing access to Japanese investors, which could be seen as a social aspect related to market inclusion, it does not directly address significant social issues such as labor practices, community engagement, or security concerns. The mention of a ""preferential tax structure"" raises governance questions regarding tax compliance and ethical business practices, which are relevant to ESG considerations. However, the primary focus remains on financial strategy rather than a comprehensive engagement with ESG issues. Overall, this sentence has some relevance to social and governance aspects but does not fully address the environmental concerns associated with cryptocurrency investments. 
    
    In summary, both sentences have some relevance to governance and social aspects but lack a direct engagement with environmental issues, which are crucial in the context of cryptocurrency.

    This sentence highlights two key aspects: financial strategy and market accessibility. The mention of reducing yen exposure is a financial maneuver that does not directly relate to ESG issues. However, the second part of the sentence regarding offering Japanese investors access to cryptocurrency with a preferential tax structure touches on social aspects, particularly in terms of market accessibility and inclusion. By providing easier access to crypto investments, Metaplanet may be contributing to financial inclusion for Japanese investors, which is a positive social impact. Nonetheless, the preferential tax structure could raise governance concerns regarding fairness and equity in taxation. Overall, this sentence has some relevance to social and governance issues, but it does not address environmental concerns directly.
