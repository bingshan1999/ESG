With etf inflows old news and even on occasion reversing to outflows, and hopes for lower interest rates diminishing daily, buyers appear to have taken to the sidelines until a new catalyst arises.
Bitcoin's disappointing second quarter price action, for now, can possibly be thought of as a correction within a larger bull move that saw the token rise nearly five-fold from january 2023 lows to a new all-time record above $73,500 in mid-march of this year.
In addition, while some bulls may have been excited that the presidential debate seemed to favor donald trump – who has recently come out as notably pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin – thielen suggested president biden's poor performance heightened the chance of a replacement democratic nominee who might end up as a far more formidable opponent in the november election.
